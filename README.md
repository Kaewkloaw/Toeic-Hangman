);
```

}
```

## How To Play

1. The webpage loads a vocabulary word from the SQLite database.
2. The system masks the word and creates blank letter slots.
3. The player guesses alphabet letters A–Z.
4. A wrong guess draws another part of the Hangman.
5. 6 mistakes = Game Over.
6. Press **New Word** to start again.

You can also add new words directly through the input panel at the top of the page.
